# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** This skill is for environments without subagent support. If subagents are available, use superpowers:subagent-driven-development instead — it provides higher quality through fresh-context-per-task and two-stage review.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with the user before starting
4. If no concerns: Create task.md artifact (using `write_to_file` with `IsArtifact: true`, `ArtifactType: "task"`) and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
1. **Generate walkthrough artifact:** Create a `walkthrough.md` artifact (using `write_to_file` with `IsArtifact: true`, `ArtifactType: "walkthrough"`, `RequestFeedback: true`) summarizing:
   - What was implemented (list of changes per component)
   - What was tested and results
   - Embed any relevant screenshots or recordings
   - Use file links to point to key changed files

2. **Finish the branch:**
   - Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
   - **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
   - Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- User updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **superpowers:using-git-worktrees** - Ensures isolated workspace (creates one or verifies existing)
- **superpowers:writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks
